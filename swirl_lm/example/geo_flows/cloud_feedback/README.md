# CloudBench Dataset

This document outlines the structure and access details for the raw and
post-processed output from 10,000 Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) driven by a
General Circulation Model (GCM), as part of the CloudBench dataset.

The data was generated by performing an ensemble of high-resolution large-eddy
simulations (LES) covering diverse meteorological conditions across the tropical
Pacific. The LES are forced with the large-scale conditions derived from a
single GCM model (the GFDL CM4) for 500 locations, 4 representative months
(January, April, July, and October), and 5 different climate scenarios.

The simulations were conducted in Swirl-LM, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
simulation framework that is accelerated by the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).
Refer to the documentation in [Swirl-LM](https://github.com/google-research/swirl-lm)
for information about installation, required hardware, and instructions on how
to run large simulations on TPU nodes in Google Cloud.

## Data Access

Our data is publicly available through two Google Cloud Storage buckets.
Post-processed statistics for all simulations are consolidated into a single
netCDF file, accessible through the `cloudbench-statistics` bucket. This
standalone file also contains key metadata for each simulation, such as the
location and emulated meteorological conditions from the GCM grid column.
The raw simulation output from the last simulated day is stored in the `zarr`
format and is publicly available in the `cloudbench-simulation-output` bucket.
The data is stored in 20-minute intervals and the 3-dimensional variables are
vertically partitioned into 8 chunks, each having dimension
(nx=124, ny=124, nz=60).

## Directory Structure

The raw output from the last simulated day of each LES is organized into its own
directory within the Google Cloud Storage bucket. The directory path follows
this structure:

```
[SITE_ID]/[MONTH]/[EXPERIMENT]/
```

For example:

```
cloudbench-simulation-output/
├── 0/
│   ├── 1/
│   │   ├── amip/
│   │   │   ├── parameters.json
│   │   │   ├── sounding.csv
│   │   │   └── data.zarr
│   │   └── amip-p4k/
│   │       └── ...
│   └── 4/
│       └── ...
└── 1/
    └── ...
```

### Path Components

  * **`SITE_ID`**: An integer from `0` to `499` that identifies a specific geolocation.
  * **`MONTH`**: An integer from `{1, 4, 7, 10}` indicating the simulated month.
  * **`EXPERIMENT`**: A string identifying the GCM experiment configuration used
  to drive the LES. Possible values are:
      * `amip`: present-day climate (baseline).
      * `amip-p4k`: 4 K SST increase relative to the baseline.
      * `amip-4xco2`: quadrupled atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration relative to the baseline.
      * `amip-p4k-2xco2`: 4 K warming with doubled CO<sub>2</sub> concentration relative to the baseline.
      * `amip-p4k-4xco2`: 4 K warming with quadrupled CO<sub>2</sub> concentration relative to the baseline.

-----

## File Descriptions

Each experiment directory contains the following files:

  * `parameters.json`: Contains pertinent metadata and a summary of the
  parameters used in the simulation.
  * `data.zarr`: Contains the raw simulation output. This data is partitioned
  (chunked in xarray) by time and vertical domain to allow for efficient loading
  and processing.
  * `sounding.csv`: Contains the atmospheric soundings extracted from the GCM
  site, which are used to initialize the simulation and compute large-scale
  forcings.

## Data Variables

The following is an exhaustive table of all variables contained in both the raw
(`data.zarr`) and post-processed (`netCDF`) data sources.
