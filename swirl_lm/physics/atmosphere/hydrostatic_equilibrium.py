class HydrostaticEquilibrium():
  """Utility functions for computing states in hydrostatic equilibrium.

    In many applications, the background state or initial state of a geophysical
    flow simulation is specified via a realistic atmospheric temperature profile
    from which it is possible to derive a corresponding hydrostatically balanced
    pressure and density. Here we assume the air mixture satisfies the ideal gas
    law.

    Using this library, the hydrostatic pressure can be computed either from a
    (virtual) temperature or from a (virtual) potential temperature profile.

    When a (virtual) temperature is provided, the hydrostatic pressure needs to
    satisfy two equations:
    1) p = ùúöRT (ideal gas law)
    2) dp/dz = -G ùúö (hydrostatic equilibrium)
    which, combined, yield:
    dp/dz = -G p / R / T
    or
    dlog(p) = -G / R / T dz.
    Integrating both sides and solving for p:
    p = p‚ÇÄexp{- ‚à´ (G / R / T) dz}

    When a (virtual) potential temperature is provided instead, then 3 equations
    must be satisfied:
    1) p = ùúöRT (ideal gas law)
    2) T = ùúÉ(p‚ÇÄ / p)**(C‚Çö / R) (potential temperature definition)
    3) dp/dz = -Gùúö (hydrostatic equilibrium)
    which, combined, yield:
    dp/dz = -Gp(p‚ÇÄ / p)**(R / C‚Çö) / R / ùúÉ
    or
    p**(-1 / ùõæ)dp = -Gp‚ÇÄ**(R / C‚Çö) / R / ùúÉ dz.
    Integrating both sides and solving for p:
    p = p‚ÇÄ[1 - ‚à´(G / C‚Çö / ùúÉ)dz]**(C‚Çö / R)

    From the given temperature and hydrostatic pressure, the hydrostatic density
    follows straightfowardly from the ideal gas law:

    ùúö = p / R / T

    Note that the pressure is computed via numerical integration of a function
    of temperature so its accuracy will depend on the grid resolution and on the
    smoothness of the given temperature profile.
