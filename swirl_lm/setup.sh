# PROTOC_URL points to a protoc binary that is compatible with the protobuf
# runtime. Swirl-LM uses the protobuf runtime that is installed by
# TensorFlow. This runtime is not compatible with the latest protoc as of
# January 2023, which is why we explicitly download a specific version. For
# TensorFlow's current protobuf runtime version, see:
#
# https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/ci_build/release/requirements_common.txt
#
# TensorFlow also installs protoc, which we could also try to use instead of
# installing our own version, but that binary is not necessarily accessible to
# the account setting up Swirl-LM.
